# ParentChildWindows

This code is written in C and uses the X11 library to create a window with a rotating square. It also demonstrates interprocess communication using shared memory. The program can be run in two modes: parent and child. If run as a child process, it reads a shared memory ID from argv[2] sent from the parent process. It then creates a new window and starts a thread that will control the rendering of the rotating square. If run as a parent process, it creates a shared memory ID and attaches to it, then initializes the window and starts the main loop. The program uses Xlib to handle events, such as key presses and mouse clicks, to control the square. It also uses pthreads to handle the rendering of the square in the child process. The square can be filled with a color by clicking inside it and can be closed by right-clicking inside it.
